# Beginner-friendly-DNN
A neural network written in Python to solve XOR problem.

Dimensions of this neural network can be changed dynamically. For XOR problem it is sufficcient to have 2 neurons in the input layer, 10 neurons in the hidden layer and 2 neurons in the output layer (classes '0' and '1'). Dimensions are changed here:
